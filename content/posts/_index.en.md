{{< typeit tag=h3 lifeLike=true >}}
This is my blog, where I write poetry.
{{< /typeit >}}

Inkwells hold tides of crystallized hours<br>
Each comma a suspended breath<br>
Between the lines glimmer sleepless constellations<br>
Let sentences bloom like paper cranes<br>
We meet where punctuation marks become lighthouses
